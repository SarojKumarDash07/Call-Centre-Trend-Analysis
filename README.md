# Call Centre Trend Analysis
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of call centre metrics, focusing on customer satisfaction, call volumes, and agent performance.
It aids in identifying areas for improvement in call centre operations.
Visualizing customer and agent behavior I created a dashboard in Power BI for Call Centre Manager(scenario) that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
The KPIs include :

• Overall customer satisfaction

• Overall calls answered/abandoned

• Calls by time

• Average speed of answer

• Agents performance quadrant -> average handle time(talk duration) vs calls answered

By leveraging my Power BI's capabilities, I was able to provide a visually engaging and informative dashboard that facilitated data-driven decision-making.
