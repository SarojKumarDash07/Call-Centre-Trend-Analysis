# Call Centre Trend Analysis
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of call centre metrics, focusing on customer satisfaction, call volumes, and agent performance.<br>
It aids in identifying areas for improvement in call centre operations.<br>
Visualizing customer and agent behavior I created a dashboard in Power BI for Call Centre Manager(scenario) that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.<br>
The KPIs include :

• Overall customer satisfaction

• Overall calls answered/abandoned

• Calls by time

• Average speed of answer

• Agents performance quadrant -> average handle time(talk duration) vs calls answered. <br>

By leveraging my Power BI's capabilities, I was able to provide a visually engaging and informative dashboard that facilitated data-driven decision-making.
